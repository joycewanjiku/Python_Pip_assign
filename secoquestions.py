# 1. Write a Python program to get a single string from two given strings, separated by a space, and swap the first two characters of each string
string1=("enter first string")
string2=("enter second string")
x=string1[0:2]
string1=string2.replace(string1[0:2],string2[0:2])
string2=string2.replace(string2[0:2],x)

print("first string has become;-string2")
# 2.  Write a Python function that takes a list of words and returns the longest word and the length of the longest one

# 3. Write a Python program that accepts a comma-separated sequence of words as input and prints the distinct words in sorted form (alphanumerically).

# 4.. Write a Python function that takes two lists and returns True if they have at least one common member.

# 5. Write a Python program to convert a list to a list of dictionaries.
# Sample lists: ["Black", "Red", "Maroon", "Yellow"], ["#000000", "#FF0000", "#800000", "#FFFF00"]

# 6. Write a Python program to check whether all dictionaries in a list are empty or not

# 7. Given a list of numbers, use list comprehension to remove all odd numbers from the list:
# numbers = [3,5,45,97,32,22,10,19,39,43]

# 8. Find the common numbers in two lists (without using a tuple or set) 
# list_a = 1, 2, 3, 4, 
# list_b = 2, 3, 4, 5 

# 9. Use a nested list comprehension to find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that are divisible by any single digit besides 1 (2-9)

# 10. Write a Python function to remove all vowels in a string
